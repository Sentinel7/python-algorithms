# Algorithms (P-1)
This repository contains a large set of algorithms which I have written in Python. I've created this repository to learn about algorithms and improve solving different common computer science problems.

### Sorting:

* Bubblesort.ipynb
* Insert+MergeSorts.ipynb (contains both Merge and Insertion sorts)
* InsertionSort1.ipynb

### Searching:

* BinarySearch.ipynb
* BinarySearch.py (same as above, but in .py file)

### Other:

* FlipCaps.ipynb (common compression algorithm, from Programming-Puzzled book)
* QuizQuestion.ipynb
